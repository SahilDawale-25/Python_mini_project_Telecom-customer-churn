## Project Overview
This project analyzes a **Telecom company’s customer data** to predict customer churn.  
The main goal is to identify factors influencing churn and provide actionable insights for reducing customer attrition.

The analysis uses **Python**, **pandas**, **numpy**, **matplotlib**, **seaborn**, and **scikit-learn** for data exploration, visualization, and predictive modeling.
